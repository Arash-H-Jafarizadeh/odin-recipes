In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website, practicing all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. 
I am going to use this project to show my skills in: 
- git
-- commit, push, pull, ...
-- good committing msg
- html
-- creating boilerplate
-- working with different elements
-- working with relative and non-relative pages
-- working with images
