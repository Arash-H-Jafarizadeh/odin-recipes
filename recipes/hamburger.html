        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            For a simple, short hamburger recipe, the key is using 80/20 ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat) for maximum juiciness.  
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb (450g) Ground beef (80/20 blend)</li>
            <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce for a flavor boost (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Form Patties: Divide the beef into 4 equal portions. Gently shape them into rounds about ¾-inch thick.</li>
            <li>The "Dimple" Trick: Press your thumb into the center of each patty to create a small dent. This prevents the burger from puffing up into a dome while cooking.</li>
            <li>Season: Generously sprinkle both sides of the patties with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook: Heat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat. Cook for 3–5 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Tip: Do not press down on the patties with your spatula, as this squeezes out the juices.</li>
            <li>Finish: If using cheese, add a slice during the last minute and cover the pan with a lid to melt it.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Tip:</h2>
        <p>
            Let the burgers rest for 3–5 minutes before serving on toasted buns with your favorite toppings.
